          Hey, I'm Keith Carrillo.
          <br />
          I'm passionate about eCommerce applications experiences that could
          potentially have a great affect on many users. In my spare time I
          enjoy talking with other developers on twitter, learning and
          communicating about new trends or new solutions.
          <br />
          Iâ€™m hoping to join a team that I can share ideas with, learn from and
          potentially grow with as a team member.
        </p>

        <ul className={styles.sociallinks}>
          {socialLinks.map((value) => (
            <li key={value.name}>
              <a href={value.link}>{value.name}</a>
              {value.component}
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </div>
